I am passionate about finance and equity investments. On investing.com data relating to indicators and analysis are displayed on multiple pages, causing loss of consequence to the user's head. So I have decided to display all the Blue Chip FTSE and DAX in a portlet. 

Upon loading the main class associated with the portlet, are triggered scanner / parser of DOM-type on a checklist of pre-selected pages (each page identifies a blue chip). These scanners gather the most relevant information and show them in a "colored" to the user in a tabular format / matrix.
